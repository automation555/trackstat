<h1>Mayday</h1>
<h2>@ MetaateM.info</h2>
<p>Welcome to Mayday. This tool was made by Erik Kastner &lt;<a href="mailto:kastner@gmail.com">kastner@gmail.com</a>&gt; for the purpose of tracking anything measurable!
Inspired by the <a href="http://ultimateblackbeltest.com" title="Ultimate Black Belt Test" alt="Ultimate Black Belt Test">UBBT</a>, and FitDay, I decided I needed a way to get inshape while A) holding myself accountable and B) showing how many of something I can do to other people.<br />
A bet with a friend inspired me to make this site more then just a quick personal thing, and then showing it to my sister (2 time particapant in the Ultimate Black Belt Test), got me to open it up to the public.<br />
So enjoy.<br />

<hr />
a few notes and rules:<br />
<ul>
    <li>This is for non-commercial use only - i.e. you can't use it to promote a personal trainging service</li>
    <li>This site is VERY VERY Beta (in testing). As such, it is subject to change, break or disappear without notice or warning - but I will try to give you a heads up if you're a memember if anything goes wrong</li>
    <li>If you have *any* comments, suggestions, bug-reports, feature requests or complaints - please let me know with an email (soon to be contact form) <a href="mailto:kastner@gmail.com">kastner@gmail.com</a></li>
</ul>
Thanks - and <strong>please</strong> have fun!
